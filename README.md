# Linear-Regression
 This repository is dedicated to practicing linear regression techniques across various projects. It covers two approaches:  Pure Python: Implementing simple and multiple linear regression from scratch, without external libraries. Using Libraries: Applying linear regression with popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. Each project demonstrates the fundamentals of both simple and multiple linear regression, allowing for hands-on learning and comparison between manual and library-based implementations.
